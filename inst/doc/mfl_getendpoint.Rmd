## Creating custom MFL API calls

```{r setup, eval = eval}
library(ffscrapr)
```

The [MFL API is extensive](https://api.myfantasyleague.com/2020/api_info?STATE=details). If there is something you'd like to access beyond the current scope of ffscrapr, you can use the lower-level "`mfl_getendpoint`" function to create a GET request and access the data, while still using the authentication and rate-limiting features I've already created. 

Here is an example of how you can call one of the endpoints - in this case, let's try searching for SFBX leagues through the leagueSearch endpoint. 

We'll start by opening up this page, https://api.myfantasyleague.com/2020/api_info?STATE=test&CCAT=export&TYPE=leagueSearch, which is the "test" page for this particular endpoint. From here, we can see that the only parameter required is "SEARCH". 

We need a connection object to pass into the mfl_getendpoint function, although in this example we don't need to give it much since the endpoint doesn't need a leagueID or username/password or APIKEY. 

```{r eval = eval}
conn <- mfl_connect(season = 2020)

conn
```
The parameters of the mfl_getendpoint function are `conn`, `endpoint`, and any other optional parameters required by the API.

The function will automatically insert the league_id, API key, and/or authentication cookies from the connection object, and will request JSON for you - so you do not need to add any of these parameters. 

It is safest to assume that everything is *case-sensitive*: the endpoint must match the case displayed by MFL ("league*S*earch") and the SEARCH argument name must be provided in upper-case. 

```{r eval = eval}
sfb_search <- mfl_getendpoint(conn,endpoint = "leagueSearch", SEARCH = "sfbx conference")

str(sfb_search, max.level = 1)

```

The function returns a list with the `query` that was sent, the `response` that was received, and the `content` that was parsed - this helps you debug the result of the function later, by inspecting the query that was sent and the response that was received.

I like to extract the `content` with `purrr::pluck` and then convert it into a tibble and unnest the content from there, but you can use base R subsetting or `magrittr::extract2` for the same purpose. 

```{r eval = eval}
search_results <- sfb_search %>% 
  purrr::pluck("content","leagues","league") %>% 
  tibble::tibble() %>% 
  tidyr::unnest_wider(1)

head(search_results)
```

## Another Example: Trade Bait

Here's another example, this time with the trade bait endpoint:  https://api.myfantasyleague.com/2020/api_info?STATE=test&CCAT=export&TYPE=tradeBait

```{r eval = eval}
fog <- mfl_connect(season = 2019, league_id = 12608)

fog_tradebait <- mfl_getendpoint(fog, "tradeBait", INCLUDE_DRAFT_PICKS = 1) %>% 
  purrr::pluck("content","tradeBaits","tradeBait") %>% 
  tibble::tibble() %>% 
  tidyr::unnest_wider(1) %>% 
  tidyr::separate_rows("willGiveUp",sep = ",") %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(timestamp = lubridate::as_datetime(as.numeric(timestamp))) %>% 
  dplyr::left_join(
    ff_franchises(fog) %>% dplyr::select("franchise_id","franchise_name"),
    by = c("franchise_id")
  ) %>% 
  dplyr::left_join(
    mfl_players(fog) %>% dplyr::select("player_id","player_name","pos","age","team"),
    by = c("willGiveUp" = "player_id")
  )

head(fog_tradebait)
```

```{r include = FALSE}
httptest::stop_mocking()

unlink(c("ffscrapr-tests-1.4.0","f.zip"), recursive = TRUE, force = TRUE)
```

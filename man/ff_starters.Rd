\usage{
ff_starters(conn, ...)

\method{ff_starters}{flea_conn}(conn, week = 1:17, ...)

\method{ff_starters}{mfl_conn}(conn, week = "all", season = NULL, ...)

\method{ff_starters}{sleeper_conn}(conn, week = 1:17, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{conn}{the list object created by \code{ff_connect()}}

\item{...}{other arguments (currently unused)}

\item{week}{a numeric or one of YTD (year-to-date) or AVG (average to date)}

\item{season}{the season of interest - generally only the most recent 2-3 seasons are available}
}
\value{
A tidy dataframe with every player for every week, including a flag for whether they were started or not
}
\description{
This function returns a tidy dataframe with one row for every starter (and bench) for every week and their scoring, if available.

\section{Methods (by class)}{
\itemize{
\item \code{flea_conn}: Fleaflicker: returns who was started as well as what they scored.

\item \code{mfl_conn}: MFL: returns the player fantasy scores for each week (not the actual stats)

\item \code{sleeper_conn}: Sleeper: returns only "who" was started, without any scoring/stats data. Only returns season specified in initial connection object.
}}

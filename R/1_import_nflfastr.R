#' Import latest nflfastr weekly stats
#'
#' Fetches a copy of the latest week-level stats from nflfastr's data repository, via the [nflreadr](https://nflreadr.nflverse.com) package.
#'
#' The goal of this data is to replicate the NFL's official weekly stats, which
#' can diverge a bit from what fantasy data feeds display.
#'
#' If you have any issues with the output of this data, please open an issue in
#' the nflfastr repository.
#'
#' @param seasons The seasons to return, TRUE returns all data available.
#' @param type One of "offense" or "kicking"
#'
#' @seealso <https://nflreadr.nflverse.com>

#' @examples
#' \donttest{
#' try( # try only shown here because sometimes CRAN checks are weird
#'   nflfastr_weekly()
#' )
#' }
#'
#' @return Weekly stats for all passers, rushers and receivers in the nflverse play-by-play data from the 1999 season to the most recent season

#' Import nflfastr roster data
#'
#' Fetches a copy of roster data from nflfastr's data repository.
#' The same input/output as nflfastr's fast_scraper_roster function.

#' If you have any issues with the output of this data, please open an issue in
#' the nflfastr repository.
